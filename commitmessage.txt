Bug fixes and completing DynamoDB implementation.

Initial idea of utilizing TTL does not work. Must add ability to delete
outdated information in the code itself.

- Changed the DateTime objects to be not nullable.
- Instead of providing DateTime.UtcNow if no date is provided, use the
date of the first WeatherData information.
- Differentiate UTC vs Local Time. All computations and storage should be UTC,
but use Local time of the station when building the report.
- Modified the name of the range key from `ObservationTime` to `ObservationTimeUtc`.
Could have made a link, but since it is development still, modified the table.
